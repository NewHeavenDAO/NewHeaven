🌌 NewHeaven Phase‑1 — Military-Grade Blockchain + AI Ecosystem
Foundations over hype. Invariants over interfaces. Recovery over features.
�
🚀 Why NewHeaven Exists

Most tech fails not because talent is lacking, but because foundations are shallow.buzzwords, and demos won’t
survive:
Network degradation
Corrupted data
Compromised signers
Adversarial conditions

We’re quietly assembling engineers who think in failure modes, not slide decks.

💡 Who We’re Looking For

Role
Skills / Focus
Icon

Full-Stack Systems
TypeScript, Node.js, React, WebGL/WebAssembly, Event-driven (Kafka)
⚡

Mobile / Edge
iOS/Android, PWA, Offline-first, Secure storage, Background signing
📱

Blockchain
Solidity (ERC-4337, wallets, NH-ID), Upgrade paths, Rollback logic, RE enforcement
⛓️

AI / ML (Security)
GNNs, Temporal models, Anomaly detection, Fraud prevention
🤖

DevOps / Security
Zero-trust infra, GitOps, Multi-cloud (AWS + GCP), Supply-chain security
🔒

Only engineers who start at the root, not the surface, should apply.

🛠 Tech Stack

-Frontend: TypeScript, React, WebGL / R3F / Babylon.js, WebAssembly, PWA

-Backend: Node.js, Deno, Kafka, Redis, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Qdrant

-Blockchain: ERC-721 (NH-ID), ERC-4337 wallets, Chainlink CCIP, API3+, Pyth

-Security: PQC (Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon), Air-gapped wallets, RE Epoch, Circuit Breaker & Rollback

-AI / ML: Deglet AI (GNN + Temporal Transformers), User AI Companion (ephemeral, RE-aware)

-Observability / Ops: Prometheus, Datadog, PostHog, Sentry, OTE


🔬 What You’ll Build

-Deterministic rollback + circuit breaker logic
-Offline-first wallet operations with air-gapped signing
-PQC-secured revocation & key lifecycle management
-AI-assisted anomaly detection & fraud prevention
-Social + blockchain integration resilient under stress
-End-to-end observability & incident intelligence pipelines
